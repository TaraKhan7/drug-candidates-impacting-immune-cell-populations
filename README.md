# 1. Instructions to Run Code
1. Ensure all packages/dependencies are installed correctly using requirements.txt.<br> 
Run the following command: <br> 
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br> 
2. (Optional) Delete cell-count.db, boxplot_yes.png, and boxplot_no.png as this will be reproduced when running app.py. <br> 
3. Run app.py using the following command: <br> 
```streamlit run app.py``` <br> 
This will run all the necessary files and create the dashboard of results.
NOTE: Each analysis file can also be run independently by running the follow command:
```python <file.name>.py```
