# 1. Instructions to Run Code
1. Ensure all packages/dependencies are installed correctly using requirements.txt
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. (Optional) Delete cell-count.db, boxplot_yes.png, and boxplot_no.png as this will be reproduced when running app.py
3. Run app.py using the following command
```streamlit run app.py```
This will run all the necessary files and create the dashboard of results
