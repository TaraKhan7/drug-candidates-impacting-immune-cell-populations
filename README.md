# 1. Instructions to Run Code
1. Ensure all packages/dependencies are installed correctly using requirements.txt. Run the following command <br> 
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br> 
2. (Optional) Delete cell-count.db, boxplot_yes.png, and boxplot_no.png as this will be reproduced when running app.py <br>
